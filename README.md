# What is it?
EasyImage allow you to eaisly take picture from gallery or camera without creating lots of boilerplate.
  
#How to use it?

##Taking straight to camera
- ```EasyImage.openCamera(Activity activity);```
- ```EasyImage.openCamera(Fragment fragment);```

##Taking straight to gallery
- ```EasyImage.openGalleryPicker(Activity activity);```
- ```EasyImage.openGalleryPicker(Fragment fragment);```

##Displaying system picker
- ```EasyImage.openChooser(Activity activity);```
- ```EasyImage.openChooser(Fragment fragment);```

Then there is only one thing left to do:

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    EasyImage.handleActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data, this, new EasyImage.Callbacks() {
        @Override
        public void onImagePickerError(Exception e, EasyImage.ImageSource source) {
            //Some error handling
        }

        @Override
        public void onImagePicked(File imageFile, EasyImage.ImageSource source) {
            //Handle the image
            onPhotoReturned(imageFile);
        }
    });
}
```


#Setup

##Runtime permissions
Library requires permission from your app. Declare it in your ```AndroidMnifest.xml```
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

**Please note** that for devices running API 23 (marshmallow) you have to request this permission in the runtime, beofre calling ```EasyImage.openCamera()```. It's demonstrated in the sample app.

**There is also one issue about runtime permissions**. According to the docs: 

``` if you app targets M and above and declares as using the CAMERA permission which is not granted, then atempting to use this action will result in a SecurityException.``` 

For this reason, if your app uses ```CAMERA``` permission, you should check it **aswell** as ```WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE``` before calling ```EasyImage.openCamera()```

[This library](https://github.com/tajchert/Nammu) will help you manage runtime permissions.

##Gradle dependency
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
    
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.jkwiecien:EasyImage:1.0.8'
}
```
